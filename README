Goals
-----
NodeJS-Keychain is intended to be a highly secure and distributable keychain web service for creation and storage of random, long passwords. Security is managed in a trap-door manner such that a single user/password combination is required to unlock a given key but all other data is entirely transparent; the purpose of this is to allow storage in the cloud.

The encryption scheme is inspired by: http://wayner.org/node/21

Usernames are stored as hashes and each user's master password as a hash of 'user_hash|password|salt'. All keys are referenced by a domain (also hashed) and are then encrypted using AES (CBC) 256 bit with the hash of 'password|user_hash|domain_hash' as the key. All hashes are SHA-512 and the one-way mechanism of cryptographic hashes makes public access to the encrypted keychain relatively safe.
